# phoneapp

This is a sample flutter app that was designed
to show how a phone app could integrate with
a churro (https://github.com/churrodata/churro) 
ETL pipeline.

The example uses http POST messages as the means
to send data from the phone into the receiving
churro ETL pipeline extract source endpoint.
